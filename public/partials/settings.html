      <h3 class="title">History</h3>
      <h4 class="subTitle"> ANGTFT was built by four Computer Science students at the University of
        Illinois at Urbana Champaign as part of their CS498: The Art and Science of Web Development.
        All four students realized that remedial tasks were not worth the time and effort. Inspired by
        websites such as Ebay and Craigslist, the four students decided to make a website that would 
        allow users to post and bid on errands.

        <h4 class="subTitle"> ANGTFT is extremely user friendly. Simply sign up and will be allowed to post errands and bid on the errands posted by other users. You may also view your errand history through your profile page. Transactions must be done in person and ANGTFT is not responsible for providing or facilitating payment. </h4>
